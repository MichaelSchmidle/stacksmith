# Stacksmith

Docker stack management for Portainer environments with Traefik reverse proxy and Authelia authentication.

## Architecture

- **Management Environment**: Runs Portainer management interface (can be any environment)
- **Agent Environments**: Run Portainer agents + individual Traefik instances
- **Auth Environment**: Runs global Authelia instance (typically on publicly accessible environment)
- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy services where they make most sense (Authelia on VPS, management on home network)

## Installation

### 1. Deploy Portainer Management Interface

Copy environment variables and deploy Portainer with Traefik:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f traefik/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 2. Add Other Portainer Environments (Optional)

Add additional environments via the Portainer management web interface. Use the command generated by Portainer to deploy agents on remote systems.

### 3. Deploy Authelia for Traefik Dashboard Security (Optional)

Deploy on publicly accessible environment (e.g., VPS) to secure Traefik dashboards and other services:
```bash
# Copy Authelia environment variables
cp authelia/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start Traefik + Authelia for public authentication
docker compose -f traefik/docker-compose.yml -f authelia/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Environment Variables

**Management Environment**: See `.env.example`  
**Traefik Environment**: See `traefik/.env.example`  
**Auth Environment**: See `authelia/.env.example`

Variables include:
- Ultra-short hostnames (`mgmt`, `auth`, `prxy`)
- Network interface binding (`TRAEFIK_INTERFACE`)
- Authelia JWT/session secrets (auth environment only)
- Cloudflare API token for Let's Encrypt
- SMTP settings and Duo 2FA integration

## Services

Services are accessible via fully customizable hostnames:
- **Portainer**: Management interface (e.g., `mgmt.j2.ms`)
- **Authelia**: Authentication service (e.g., `auth.j2.ms`)  
- **Traefik**: Dashboard (e.g., `prxy.j2.ms`)

## Security

- Management interface can bind to Tailscale for enhanced security
- Authelia deployed on publicly accessible environment for proper authentication redirects
- All environments support flexible interface binding (private/public)
- Duo 2FA protection across all services and environments
- Let's Encrypt certificates via Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge

## Deployment Examples

**Scenario 1: Home + VPS**
- VPS: Traefik + Authelia (public authentication)
- Home: Traefik + Portainer management (private)
- All services authenticate via VPS Authelia

**Scenario 2: All Public**  
- Single VPS: All services with global authentication
